# microk8striplepicluster
An experiement I'm doing to learn about kubernetes and containerization in general. This takes three raspberry pis (in my case, two raspi 3's and a new 8gb ram raspi 5 all using 64gb sd cards) and attempts to create a cluster to run an application in the same way as larger kubernetes, to learn about the yaml file format and deploying applications.
